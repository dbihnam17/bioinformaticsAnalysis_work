# bioinformaticsAnalysis_work

This repository is a collection of scripts, workflows, and code snippets I’ve written during my work as a research technologist in the Braggio cancer genomics lab at the Mayo Clinic. It reflects the kinds of computational analyses, data processing, and automation tasks I’ve handled across various projects.
